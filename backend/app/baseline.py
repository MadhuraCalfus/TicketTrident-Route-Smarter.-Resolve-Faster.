"""A deliberately simple, keyword-only ticket classifier.

Serves two purposes in this project:
1. It's the offline fallback used when there's no API key / FORCE_MOCK_MODE=true,
   so the whole app is demoable without ever touching the network.
2. It's the "naive baseline" shown side-by-side with Claude's classification,
   so the difference between keyword matching and real language understanding
   is something you can point at on screen instead of just asserting.

Nothing here calls an LLM. It is intentionally rigid: no notion of sarcasm,
negation, multi-issue tickets, or context — which is exactly the point.
